Point of View,Point of view is clearly described as to how it relates to the studio brief.,1Point of View,The problem and solution are clearly stated.,1Point of View,The solution requirement is not too general (any solution meets the requirement) nor too specific (allows for only one solution).,1Inspiration Quality,At minimum 5 words and 5 visual inspirations with explanations.,1Inspiration Quality,Words and visual inspiration relate to the design idea.,1Inspiration Quality,Inspirations were diverse and had insightful explanations. The inspirations weren't obvious (didn't require observation) and/or the explanations weren't vague and confusing (it would be hard to implement a solution based on them).,1Storyboard #1,"Storyboard #1 submitted and reasonably addresses the problems identified in the point of view, but a reader may have lingering questions about the situation depicted.",1Storyboard #1,The storyboard is easy to follow. Someone else could come up with a distinct prototype that would correspond with the point of view just from looking at the storyboard.,1Storyboard #2,"Storyboard #2 submitted and reasonably addresses the problems identified in the point of view, but a reader may have lingering questions about the situation depicted.",1Storyboard #2,The storyboard is easy to follow. Someone else could come up with a distinct prototype that would correspond with the point of view just from looking at the storyboard.,1Prototype #1,Submitted Prototype #1.,1Prototype #1,"The prototype has enough detail that the user can see all of the interactions, understand how they work, and a programmer could use the prototype to create a functional application with a defined flow.",1Prototype #1,The prototype connects to the point of view.,1Prototype #2,Submitted Prototype #2.,1Prototype #2,"The prototype has enough detail that the user can see all of the interactions, understand how they work, and a programmer could use the prototype to create a functional application with a defined flow.",1Prototype #2,The prototype clearly diverges from the first prototype and explores different interfaces implementing the same point of view.,1
